## Predicting the Outcome of SpaceX Launches  

This research project aims to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.   
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches are advertised to save cost by 60% if SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Determining the outcome of the first stage lauch will therefore be important for evaluating costs. 


### Project Contents:  
 *  Collect data using SpaceX REST API and web scraping  
 *  Wrangle data to prepare for analysis
 *  Explore data with data visualization as well as SQL
 *  Build interactive map with Folium to explore features of launch sites
 *  Build interactive dashboard to explore the importance of launch site and payload mass for mission outcome
 *  Build and evaluate four machine learning classification models to predict landing outcome
