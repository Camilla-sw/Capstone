## Predicting Outcomes of SpaceX Launches  

This research project aims to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.   
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches are advertised to save cost by 60% if SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Determining the outcome of the first stage lauch will be important for evaluating costs. 


### Project Contents:  
 *  Collect data using SpaceX REST API and web scraping  
 *  Wrangle data to prepare for analysis
 *  Explore data with data visualization as well as SQL
 *   Build interactive map with Folium and interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash to explore the importance of launch site and payload mass
 *   Build and evaluate four classification models to predict landing outcomes
