## Predicting Outcomes of Rocket Launches  

This research project aims to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.   
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches are advertised to save cost by 60% because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 


### Research Steps:  
 ** Collect data using SpaceX REST API and web scraping
 ** Wrangle data to prepare for analysis 
 ** Explore data with data visualization as well as SQL 
 ** Build interactive map with Folium and interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash to explore the importance of launch site and payload mass
 ** Build and evaluate four classification models to predict landing outcomes
